# Final_Project


The purpose of our project is to propose a machine learning method forbreast cancer diagnosis. The data used for this analysis  is from the University of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison and was created by Dr. William H. Wolberg.

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

Tools: Python, pandas, plotly-Heroku, ML models,  -Javascript -D3 PostgresSQL-HTML/CSS


The folder has the following files:


Jupyter notebook labeled as Breast_Cancer_Exploratory Analysis. It has all the syntax I used to upload the file (pandas) and the process of verifying the relevant variables. Essentially I tested possible linear correlation between the different attributes, identified the ones with the highest coefficients (> 0.85) and removed them from the final data to be modelled.
